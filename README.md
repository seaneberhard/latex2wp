### How to install

You need python 3.6+. You can install latex2wp using pip:

`pip install git+https://github.com/seaneberhard/latex2wp`.

### How to use

Use template/post-template.tex as a starting point, writing your text between the `\begin{document}` and `\end{document}`. In the directory of your tex file, do

`latex2wp yourlatexfile.tex`.

This will produce a file called `yourlatexfile.html`, which is ready to be cut and pasted into WordPress. Pure HTML can be produced by adding the `--html` option.

For more information, try

`latex2wp --help`.

--------------------

### What works and what doesn't

See the file `latex2wp/test/resources/example.tex` to see how to import figures, have text appear in different colors, have links to URLs, and enter the "more" command of WordPress.

Anything between `\iftex...\fi` is compiled in LaTeX but ignored in the conversion to WordPress; anything between `\ifblog...\fi` is converted to WordPress but ignored by LaTeX. Anything between `\iffalse...\fi` is ignored by both.

There is very limited support for macros. All macros must be defined with `\def`, they must have no arguments, they must be independent, and they must appear outside the main `\begin{document}...\end{document}` block.

Several theorem-like numbered environments are supported,
such as `theorem`, `lemma`, `proposition`, `conjecture`, `remark`, `corollary`, `example`, and `exercise`. In addition, there is the `proof` environment.

You can use the inline math environment `$...$`, `\(...\)` and the displayed math environments `$$...$$`, `\[...\]`, `\begin{equation}...\end{equation}`. WordPress has some limitations to the kind of latex equations it can display. As a consequence, `align` and `eqnarray` are not supported. You can, however, use `eqnarray*`, and you can use `array` inside a math environment.

The tabular environment works.

The reference commands `\label{}`, `\eqref{}`, and `\ref{}` work in the standard way.

There is no support for `\medskip`, `\bigskip` and other such formatting commands. The return command `\\` is recognized.

`\section`, `\section*`, `\subsection` and `\subsection*` are supported, but not `\subsubsection` and so on. 

There is no support for bibliographic references or footnotes.

------------------------

### How to customize

The file `latex2wp/style.py` can be easily modified to add to add new theorem-like environments or change their numbering conventions, or to change the typesetting design of theorem-like environments and other details. To do this you will need to clone the git repo, and pip install your local version by doing `pip install .` in your checkout.

For example, suppose you want to change the formatting of theorem-like environments. The string `beginthm` specifies what to do at the beginning of a theorem-like environment. In the string, `_ThmType_` will be replaced by the type of theorem (e.g. `Theorem`, or `Lemma`, or `Corollary`, etc.) and `_ThmNumb_` will be replaced by the theorem number. So the standard setting

`beginthm= "\n<blockquote><b>_ThmType_ _ThmNumb_</b> <em>"`

will start a blockquote environment, write in boldface something like "Theorem 3", and then start an emphasized environment. `beginnamedthm` specifies what to do at the beginning of a theorem-like environment declared by something like

`\begin{theorem}[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]...`

the string `_ThmName_` holds the content of the text in square brackets in the original LaTeX. `endthm` specifies what to do at the end of a theorem-like environment.
